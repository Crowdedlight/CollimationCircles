# Collimation Circles

This program was inspired by Mire De Collimation program written by Gilbert Grillot. I decided to add some features and make it platform independed. 
Colimation Circles is developed with .NET 6 and AvaloniaUI Framework.

# Features
- support multiple circle or cross shapes
- user interface for managing list of shapes
- scaling of whole setup
- transparent background
- fully customizable shapes: radius, thickness, color, spacing, rotation, label
- support for profile saving and loading
- multiple platform support (Windows, Linux, Mac OS)
