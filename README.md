# Collimation Circles

This program was inspired by Mire De Collimation program written by Gilbert Grillot and Al's Collimation Aid. Both programs missed some features, so I decided to write my own tool. 

Colimation Circles is developed with .NET 6 and AvaloniaUI Framework, and can run on multiple platforms like Windows, Linux and Mac OS.

# Features

- support multiple shapes (circle, cross, screws)
- user interface for managing list of shapes
- scaling up or down of whole setup
- transparent background
- fully customizable shapes: radius, thickness, color, spacing, rotation, label
- support for profile saving and loading
- precise position control with keyboard
- multiple platform support (Windows, Linux, Mac OS)
